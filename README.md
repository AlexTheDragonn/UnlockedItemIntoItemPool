# Unlocked Item Into Item Pool
Whenever an item gets unlocked, it gets added to the item pool. **This means that every item dropped _after_ the unlock will have a chance of being that item.** Items dropped in the past use their own item pool and will not get updated.

Please note: This mod has not been tested in multiplayer or with mods, but it should work in an otherwise vanilla setting.
